## Introduction

This app is a component of the ILIAS Learnplaces plugin.
It guides users to various learnplaces and provides detailed information about each location.
Additionally, the app allows users to store all data for offline access.
At each learnplace, users can scan a QR code to confirm their visit and get learning progress in ILIAS.
